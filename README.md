# Eric PERRET

**Engineer first, language second.**

I design algorithms and simulations. Then I choose the right tool.  
For universal deployment — PC, tablet, smartphone — the browser is the runtime.

`HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript` — Zero dependencies. Runs everywhere.

### What I build

**Signal Processing** — Acoustic localization, TDOA, Doppler tracking, DVB-S transmission chains  
**Cryptanalysis** — Classical cipher breaking, frequency analysis, dictionary attacks  
**Structural Engineering** — Seismic simulations, TMD systems, base isolation  
**Healthcare Tools** — Medical training, triage systems, music therapy applications

### Philosophy

```
Analysis → Design → Algorithm → Then choose the language.
Not the other way around.
```

Portable. Autonomous. No framework. No build step.  
Open the file. It works.
